      Create a `Dog` class with an `__init__()` method that takes `name` and `breed` as arguments. Include a `bark()` method. Instantiate two Dog objects with different data and demonstrate calling the method and accessing the attributes, as shown in the notes.
      Use the following: Bruce (Scottish Terrier) and Freya (Greyhound).

      class Dog:
          def __init__(self, name, breed):
              self.name = name

          def bark(self):

      dog1 = Dog("Bruce", "Scottish Terrier")

      Create two classes:

      1. `Owner` with attributes: `name`, `address`, and `phone_number`.  
         - The `__init__` method should accept `name`, `address`, and a parameter named `contact_number` which should be assigned to the attribute `phone_number`.

      2. `Dog` with attributes: `name`, `breed`, and `owner`.  
         - The `owner` should be an instance of the `Owner` class.
         - Include a method `bark()` that prints `"Woof woof"`.

      Then:
      - Create two `Owner` objects and two `Dog` objects, each assigned one of the owners.
      - Print each dog's owner's name using dot notation (e.g., `dog1.owner.name`).
      Use the following data:
      - Owner 1: Name: Danny, Address: 122 Springfield Drive, Contact Number: 8888999
      - Owner 2: Name: Sally, Address: 122 Springfield Drive, Contact Number: 8888999
      - Dog 1: Name: Bruce, Breed: Scottish Terrier, Owner: Owner 1
      - Dog 2: Name: Freya, Breed: Greyhound, Owner: Owner 2
      Ensure the output shows the owner's name for each dog.
