### âœ… Final Clean Code (with logging and validation in getters and setters)

```python
from datetime import datetime

class User:
    def __init__(self, username, email, password):
        self.username = username
        self._email = email  # protected attribute
        self.password = password

    def get_email(self):
        print(f"Email accessed at {datetime.now()}")
        return self._email

    def set_email(self, new_email):
        if "@" in new_email:
            self._email = new_email
        else:
            print("Invalid email address. Email not updated.")

# Create user
user1 = User("dantheman", "  DAN@GMAIL.com ", "123")

# Try accessing email
print(user1.get_email())  # Logs access time and prints email

# Try setting invalid email
user1.set_email("invalid_email")
print(user1.get_email())  # Should still be old email

# Try setting valid email
user1.set_email("danny@outlook.com")
print(user1.get_email())  # Should be updated
```

### ðŸ“Œ Summary of Key Concepts

* **Why not just access attributes directly?**

  * Direct access is easy but **unsafe**.
  * Using `user.email = "bad"` bypasses all validation and logic.

* **Getter Methods (`get_email`)**

  * Give you a **central place** to add behavior when reading data (e.g., log access time).
  * You could later add permissions, logging, etc., without changing every place in your program.

* **Setter Methods (`set_email`)**

  * Allow validation before updating data.
  * In this case, it checks if the new email contains `"@"`.
  * Prevents garbage values and keeps your data **safe and clean**.

* **Why this is better:**

  * More maintainable: all logic is in one place.
  * Cleaner: fewer bugs and unexpected behaviors.
  * Scalable: you can later check user roles, enforce formats, hit databases, etc.

* **Next: Pythonâ€™s `@property` decorator**

  * Removes the need to call `get_email()` or `set_email("x")`.
  * Lets you use `user.email` and `user.email = "x"` with the same safety and control.
  * Thatâ€™s what youâ€™ll see in the next lesson.
