### üß† **Python Objects and Classes ‚Äî Key Concepts**

#### ‚úÖ Everything in Python is an **object**.

* Whether you create a string, number, list, etc., it's always an object behind the scenes.

#### üîπ **Variables as Objects**

```python
name = "Danny"   # String object
age = 29         # Integer object
```

* Use `type()` to check the object's type:

```python
print(type(name))  # <class 'str'>
print(type(age))   # <class 'int'>
```

* These objects are created from **classes**:

  * `str` class ‚Üí for string objects
  * `int` class ‚Üí for integer objects

#### üîπ **What are Classes?**

* **Classes** are **blueprints** for objects.
* They define:

  * What data the object holds
  * What operations (methods/functions) can be performed on it

#### üîπ **Object Behaviors via Methods**

* Objects have **methods** (aka functions in OOP) that define how they behave.

```python
print(name.upper())  # Output: DANNY
```

* Here, `.upper()` is a method from the `str` class that returns the string in uppercase.
* `str` methods operate on string data (e.g., converting case, splitting, searching, etc.)

#### üîπ **Different Classes, Different Methods**

* `str` objects (like `name`) and `int` objects (like `age`) have **different available methods**.
* This is because each class defines its own specific functionality.

#### üí° Summary

* `str` and `int` are examples of **Python's built-in classes**.
* These classes help create data types like strings and integers.
* Methods (e.g., `.upper()`) allow manipulation of the object's internal data.
* You can inspect what class an object belongs to using `type()`.

## üê∂ **Classes, Objects, Methods, and Attributes in Python**

### üîπ **Creating a Simple Class**

```python
class Dog:
    def bark(self):
        print("Woof woof")
```

* `class Dog:` defines a new class named `Dog`.
* `def bark(self):` defines a method (function inside a class).
* `self` is a required parameter for all instance methods (more on that later).

### üîπ **Creating Objects (Instances)**

```python
dog1 = Dog()
dog1.bark()     # Output: Woof woof

dog2 = Dog()
dog2.bark()     # Output: Woof woof
```

* Objects are created by **calling the class like a function**.
* `dog1.bark()` calls the method defined in the class.
* Currently, all Dog objects behave the same.

## üîπ **Making Objects More Useful ‚Äî Adding Attributes**

### ‚úÖ Use the `__init__()` method (a special constructor method)

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed

    def bark(self):
        print("Woof woof")
```

* `__init__()` is automatically called **when the object is created**.
* `self.name = name` and `self.breed = breed` store values in the object.
* `self` refers to the current instance of the class.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Typo in your code: `_init__` should be `__init__`

---

### üîπ **Using the Updated Class**

```python
dog1 = Dog("Bruce", "Scottish Terrier")
dog2 = Dog("Freya", "Greyhound")

dog1.bark()                     # Woof woof
print(dog1.name)               # Bruce
print(dog1.breed)              # Scottish Terrier

dog2.bark()                     # Woof woof
print(dog2.name)               # Freya
print(dog2.breed)              # Greyhound
```

* Each object now has **unique data** (`name` and `breed`).
* Methods and attributes are both accessed with **dot notation**.

| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `class`      | Defines a blueprint for creating objects                                |
| `object`     | An instance of a class                                                  |
| `__init__()` | Constructor method to initialize object data                            |
| `self`       | Refers to the current object instance                                   |
| Attribute    | Data stored in an object (`self.name`, `self.breed`)                    |
| Method       | Function defined inside a class (like `bark`)                           |
| Dot notation | Used to access methods and attributes (e.g. `dog1.name`, `dog1.bark()`) |
