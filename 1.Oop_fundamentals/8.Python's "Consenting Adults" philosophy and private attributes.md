Here's a concise set of **notes** summarizing this section on **Python’s “Consenting Adults” philosophy** and **private attributes with name mangling**:

## 🧠 Python’s “Consenting Adults” Philosophy

> *“We’re all adults here.”* – Guido van Rossum

* **Python trusts developers** to behave responsibly.
* Attributes prefixed with **a single underscore (`_email`)** are **protected by convention**, not enforcement.
* You **can** access them, but **shouldn’t** unless necessary.
* Unlike Java or C++, Python does **not enforce** access control strictly.

---

## 🔐 Making Attributes **Private** in Python

### ➕ Use **double underscores (`__`)** to make attributes truly private:

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, username, email, password):
        self.username = username
        self.__email = email    # 👈 Truly private
        self.password = password
```

---

### 🔎 What Happens Internally?

* Python performs **name mangling**:

  * `self.__email` becomes `_User__email` internally.
  * Prevents accidental access from outside the class.
  * Raises `AttributeError` if accessed as `user.__email`.

---

## 🧪 Example: Access Fails

```python
user = User("alice", "alice@example.com", "pass123")
print(user.__email)  # ❌ Raises AttributeError
```

### ✅ But You *Can* Still Access It If You Know Mangled Name (not recommended):

```python
print(user._User__email)  # ⚠️ Technically works, but discouraged
```

## ✅ Summary Table

| Prefix    | Meaning                   | Enforced? | Use Case                       |
| --------- | ------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------ |
| `email`   | Public                    | ❌         | Can be accessed freely         |
| `_email`  | Protected (by convention) | ❌         | Shouldn’t access outside class |
| `__email` | Private (name mangled)    | ✅         | Hidden from outside completely |
