Perfect! Here's a **cleaned-up and functional version** of the code using Pythonâ€™s `@property` feature, followed by a **clear summary** of what was taught in this part of the lesson.

### âœ… Final Clean Code Using `@property`

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, username, email, password):
        self.username = username
        self._email = email  # Protected by convention
        self.password = password

    @property
    def email(self):
        print("Email accessed")
        return self._email


# Creating a user
user1 = User("dantheman", "dan@gmail.com", "123")

# Accessing email via property
print(user1.email)

# Attempting to set directly (this will still work because setter not defined yet)
user1.email = "this is not an email"  # This will raise an AttributeError
```

ðŸ”´ The last line will **fail** because weâ€™ve defined a getter, but not a setter. Weâ€™ll fix that in the next step.

### ðŸ§  Key Takeaways (Summary)

#### âœ… What are properties in Python?

* A Pythonic way to **control access** to class attributes (like getters and setters) **without changing how the attributes are used.**
* You define a method and **decorate it with `@property`** to make it behave like an attribute.

#### ðŸ”’ Why use properties instead of direct attribute access?

* They allow you to **add logic (like logging, validation)** without changing how the code is used.
* Example: `user.email` still works as before, even if it's now a property with logic.
* **No need to update any existing code** using the classâ€”clean and maintainable!

#### ðŸ‘Ž Problem with direct access:

```python
user.email = "nonsense"
```

* This works even if itâ€™s not a valid email.
* Thereâ€™s **no validation**, and this could break your programâ€™s data integrity.

#### âœ… Why properties are better than getter/setter methods:

* Traditional getters/setters:

  ```python
  user.get_email()
  user.set_email("abc@example.com")
  ```

  Require **changing all code** that accesses the attribute.

* With `@property`, you keep using:

  ```python
  user.email
  user.email = "abc@example.com"
  ```

  Even when you add logic under the hood. Existing code **doesn't break**.

### ðŸ”œ Whatâ€™s Next?

Youâ€™ll now define a **setter** using the `@<property>.setter` decorator, like this:

```python
@email.setter
def email(self, value):
    if "@" in value:
        self._email = value
    else:
        print("Invalid email address")
```

Want me to clean and summarize that part too when you get to it?
