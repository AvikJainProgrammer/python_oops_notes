## üß± **Python OOP: Object Relationships with Classes**

### üê∂ Previously:

You had a `Dog` class with:

* Attributes: `name`, `breed`
* Method: `bark()`

---

## üßë **Step 1: Creating an `Owner` Class**

```python
class Owner:
    def __init__(self, name, address, contact_number):
        self.name = name
        self.address = address
        self.phone_number = contact_number  # Field name differs from parameter
```

* `Owner` objects have:

  * `name`
  * `address`
  * `phone_number` (note: parameter name is `contact_number`)
* Demonstrates that **parameter names and attribute names can differ**.

---

## üêæ **Step 2: Updating `Dog` to Include an Owner**

### Revised `Dog` class:

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed, owner):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed
        self.owner = owner  # owner is another object
    def bark(self):
        print("Woof woof")
```

* Now each `Dog` object **includes an `Owner` object**.
* The `owner` parameter accepts an instance of the `Owner` class.

---

## üêï‚Äçü¶∫ **Step 3: Creating Objects with Relationships**

```python
owner1 = Owner("Danny", "122 Springfield Drive", "8888999")
owner2 = Owner("Sally", "122 Springfield Drive", "8888999")

dog1 = Dog("Bruce", "Scottish Terrier", owner1)
dog2 = Dog("Freya", "Greyhound", owner2)
```

* `dog1` is assigned `owner1`, and `dog2` is assigned `owner2`.
* This establishes a **"has-a" relationship**:

  * Dog *has an* Owner.

---

## üîç **Accessing Nested Object Data**

You can access the owner's attributes through the dog object:

```python
print(dog1.owner.name)   # Danny
print(dog2.owner.name)   # Sally
```

* Dot notation works recursively:

  * `dog1.owner` ‚Üí returns the `Owner` object
  * `.name` accesses the `name` attribute of that `Owner`

| Concept              | Description                                                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Class                | Blueprint for creating related objects                      |
| Object               | An instance of a class                                      |
| Attribute            | Data held by an object (e.g., `self.name`)                  |
| Method               | Function inside a class (`bark()`)                          |
| `__init__()`         | Constructor that initializes object attributes              |
| Object relationships | Objects can contain **other objects** as attributes         |
| Dot notation         | Used to access nested object data (e.g., `dog1.owner.name`) |
| Has-a relationship   | Dog *has an* Owner ‚Äî one object contains another            |
