Here’s a set of **concise but complete notes** summarizing this segment. These build on what we've already covered and clarify terminology and concepts like `self`, attributes, and instantiation:

---

## 🧰 **OOP Concept Recap in Python**

### 📦 Class

* A **class** is a **blueprint** for creating objects.
* It defines:

  * **Attributes** (data)
  * **Methods** (behaviors)

### 🧍 Object / Instance

* An **object** is a **specific instance of a class**.
* Each object has **its own data** and methods based on the class.

> ✅ Example:
> `Dog` is a class → `dog1` and `dog2` are instances (objects) of that class.

---

## 🔡 Attributes

* **Attributes** are **variables stored inside an object**.
* Represent the **state or properties** of the object.

> 🐶 Example:
> `dog1` has:
>
> * `name = "Bruce"`
> * `breed = "Scottish Terrier"`
> * `owner = owner1`

---

## 🛠️ Methods

* **Methods** are **functions inside a class**.
* Define **behaviors** the object can perform.

> 🐶 Example:
> `bark()` is a method of the `Dog` class.
> `dog1.bark()` → `"Woof woof"`

---

## 🧭 `self` Parameter

* `self` refers to the **current instance** of the class.
* It allows access to:

  * The object’s own attributes (`self.name`, `self.breed`)
  * Its methods from within the class.

> 🧠 Analogy:
> If each object is a person, `self` means "me" inside that person’s methods.

> 🔁 When creating an object:

```python
dog1 = Dog("Bruce", "Scottish Terrier", owner1)
```

* Inside `__init__`, `self` refers to `dog1`.

```python
self.name = name  # Sets dog1.name = "Bruce"
```

---

## 🏗️ Instantiation

* **To instantiate** a class means to **create an object** from that class.
* The created object is called an **instance** of the class.

> ✅ Example:

```python
dog1 = Dog("Bruce", "Scottish Terrier", owner1)
```

* This line **instantiates** the `Dog` class.
* `dog1` is an **instance** of the `Dog` class.

## 📘 Terminology Clarification

| Term              | Meaning                                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Class             | The blueprint or template                                           |
| Object / Instance | A specific, usable item created from a class                        |
| Instantiation     | The act of creating an object from a class                          |
| Attribute         | A variable tied to an object (e.g., `self.name`)                    |
| Method            | A function defined within a class (e.g., `bark()`)                  |
| `self`            | Refers to the current object (instance) inside the class definition |
