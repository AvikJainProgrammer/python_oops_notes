Here's a **clear summary** based on your transcript, focused on **when to use static vs. instance attributes** in Python, along with practical examples.

### ✅ When to Use **Static (Class) Attributes**

**Use static attributes when:**

1. 🔢 **You need a counter or tracker**

   * Example: `User.user_count` to track how many `User` objects have been created.
   * Shared across all instances.

2. 🧾 **You have shared constants or defaults**

   * Example: `Tax.rate = 0.18` – a GST or VAT rate for all invoices.

3. ⚙️ **Class-level configuration**

   * Example: default timeout for all network requests.

**Access using:**

```python
ClassName.attribute  # Preferred
instance.attribute   # Also works, but not recommended
```

### ✅ When to Use **Instance Attributes**

**Use instance attributes when:**

1. 📄 **Data is unique per object**

   * Example: `user1.username = "alice"`, `user2.username = "bob"`

2. 🐕 **Objects have their own identity or state**

   * Example: A `Dog` object has `breed`, `age`, `name` – all instance-specific.

**Access using:**

```python
self.attribute  # inside the class
instance.attribute  # outside the class
```

### 🧠 Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature              | Instance Attribute                     | Static (Class) Attribute           |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Belongs to           | Individual object                      | The class itself                   |
| Defined in           | `__init__()` or other instance methods | Directly in the class body         |
| Accessed using       | `self.attribute` or `object.attribute` | `Class.attribute` (preferred)      |
| Memory per instance? | ✅ Yes                                  | ❌ Only one shared copy             |
| When to use          | Object-specific state                  | Shared config, counters, constants |

### ✅ Example Recap

```python
class User:
    user_count = 0  # Static attribute

    def __init__(self, username, email):
        self.username = username  # Instance attribute
        self.email = email        # Instance attribute
        User.user_count += 1
```
