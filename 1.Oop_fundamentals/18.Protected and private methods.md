Thanks ‚Äî you're giving me a clear picture of what the course is trying to convey. Here's a clean and **summarized breakdown** of what this part covers, including a corrected version of your code, and key takeaways.

## üîê **Controlling Access to Methods in Python: Public, Protected, Private**

In Python, **naming conventions** using underscores help control method access:

| Modifier  | Syntax       | Access Level                                               | Use Case                                  |
| --------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Public    | `method()`   | Fully accessible from anywhere                             | General purpose methods                   |
| Protected | `_method()`  | Meant for internal use and subclasses only (by convention) | Helper methods within class or subclasses |
| Private   | `__method()` | Name mangled to prevent external access                    | Strictly internal use only                |

### ‚úÖ Example ‚Äî Corrected & Cleaned Code:

```python
class BankAccount:
    MIN_BALANCE = 100

    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self._balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if self._is_valid_amount(amount):
            self._balance += amount
            self.__log_transaction("deposit", amount)
        else:
            print("Deposit amount must be positive.")

    def _is_valid_amount(self, amount):
        return amount > 0

    def __log_transaction(self, transaction_type, amount):
        print(f"Logging {transaction_type} of ${amount}. New balance: ${self._balance}")
```

### üîé Explanation of Each Method

* **`deposit(self, amount)`**

  * A **public** method: users call this directly to deposit money.

* **`_is_valid_amount(self, amount)`**

  * A **protected** method: utility check for positive deposit.
  * Can be used in subclasses (e.g. if we subclass `BankAccount` to `PremiumAccount` later).

* **`__log_transaction(self, transaction_type, amount)`**

  * A **private** method: logs the transaction.
  * Cannot be called from outside the class due to *name mangling*.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Happens If You Try This?

```python
account = BankAccount("Alice", 500)
account._is_valid_amount(100)  # Works, but shouldn't be accessed directly
account.__log_transaction("test", 100)  # ‚ùå Fails: AttributeError
```

Because `__log_transaction` becomes `_BankAccount__log_transaction` under the hood.

### üîê Summary: When to Use Each

| You want to...                                         | Use                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Allow full access                                      | `def method()` (public)     |
| Use a helper method internally & allow subclass access | `def _method()` (protected) |
| Strictly limit use inside this class only              | `def __method()` (private)  |

Let me know if you'd like me to include a **`withdraw()` method**, inheritance examples, or an **interactive quiz** to check your understanding.
