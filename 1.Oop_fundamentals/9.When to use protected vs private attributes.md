Here's a clear **summary of the differences between protected and private variables in Python**, as discussed:

## 🔐 Protected vs Private Variables in Python

| Feature                       | **Protected (`_var`)**       | **Private (`__var`)**                       |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Prefix**                    | Single underscore `_`        | Double underscore `__`                      |
| **Access inside class**       | ✅ Allowed                    | ✅ Allowed                                   |
| **Access outside class**      | ⚠️ Allowed (but discouraged) | ❌ Not allowed directly (raises error)       |
| **Name Mangling**             | ❌ No                         | ✅ Yes — becomes `_ClassName__var`           |
| **Enforced by Python?**       | ❌ No — only a convention     | ✅ Yes — through name mangling               |
| **Intended Use**              | Internal use (by convention) | Strongly internal (harder to access)        |
| **Readability & Flexibility** | ✅ More flexible, readable    | ❌ Less flexible, more hidden                |
| **Best Use Case**             | Most internal-use scenarios  | When strict hiding is **absolutely** needed |

### 🧪 Example Access

#### 🔸 Protected

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, email):
        self._email = email  # protected

user = User("a@b.com")
print(user._email)  # ⚠️ Technically allowed, but not recommended
```

#### 🔹 Private (Name Mangled)

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, email):
        self.__email = email  # private

user = User("a@b.com")
print(user.__email)  # ❌ AttributeError

# Can only be accessed like this (not recommended):
print(user._User__email)  # ✅ But violates encapsulation
```

## ✅ Which Should You Use?

> 🔸 **Use `_protected`** by default to signal internal use.
> 🔹 **Use `__private`** only if:

* You really need to **hide the variable**
* Or you’re building something complex (e.g. large libraries or frameworks) and want to prevent accidental access.
